Engauge tracks the amount of time you spend in voice channels and rewards you
with [XP](/overview/xp) for your participation.

By default, every minute you spend in a voice channel nets you **4 XP**, but
this can be configured per server on the [dashboard](/config/dashboard).

Engauge cannot hear you or listen into your conversations; this feature works by
monitoring when you join and leave voice channels.

## Audibility

Tracking occurs for a user when they are "audible," which is when a user

- is in a voice channel
- the voice channel has more than one person in it
  - Bots don't count. Sorry, that's cheating!
- they are not muted or server muted
- they are not deafened or server deafened

Engauge will "save" your voice minutes when you transition from being
**audible** to **inaudible**, or vice versa. This naturally happens through
muting or leaving the voice channel.

:::note

You will not see your voice minutes update until you mute or leave the voice
channel.

## Troubleshooting

If Engauge is not properly tracking your voice activity, first
[read above](#audibility) to ensure you understand the concept of
**audibility**.

However, if the issue persists you may try to

- **Have the user mute or leave the voice channel they are in.**
  - This will cause Engauge to "save" the voice minutes they are currently
    accumulating. They will also level up if they earned enough XP due to their
    voice XP.
- **Check that Engauge can see the voice channel the user is in.**
  - This is generally due to a lack of permissions, and can easily be fixed by
    giving Engauge the **Administrator** permission.
  - Alternatively, make sure Engauge can see the category and channel that the
    voice channel is in.

If none of these tips help, get in touch with us on
[our support server](https://engau.ge/support) and we can take a look at your
issue.

## Modifying voice activity

Unlike experience, voice minutes **cannot** be modified by administrators. See
our policy on [data legitimacy](/setup/legitimacy).
