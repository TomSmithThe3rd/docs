Engauge introduces the concept of **experience** (XP) to your Discord server. By
default, members can earn XP by [chatting](/overview/messages) or
[participating in voice channels](/overview/voice), but this can be configured
per-server in the [dashboard](/setup/dashboard).

You can view your experience from the [/stats](/commands/stats),
[/rank](/commands/rank), and [/leaderboard](/commands/leaderboard) commands, the
[leaderboard](/overview/leaderboard), or the [dashboard](/config/dashboard).

## Levels

As you earn experience, you will periodically level up. Depending on how the
server you are interacting in is configured, you can earn
[currency](/config/economy), [roles](/config/roles), and more as you level up.

The frequency at which you level up depends on your current level. The higher
your level, the more XP it takes to reach the next level.

The exact frequency depends on the server's configured level formula.

### Level formulas

The **level formula** for a server dictates how much XP is required for a user
to level up from each level. There are different formulas offered that allow for
quicker (and slower) level up speeds.

For more information, view the
[main site leveling formulas page](https://engau.ge/formulas).
