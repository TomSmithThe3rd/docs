Engauge tracks messages you send and rewards you with [XP](/overview/xp) for
sending them.

By default, sending a message nets you **15 XP**, but this can be configured per
server on the [dashboard](/config/dashboard).

Engauge does not store the contents of your messages or the times at which your
messages were sent. It tracks message activity by increasing a numeric counter
when messages are sent.

## Spam prevention

Engauge does **not reward you** for sending messages **multiple times a
minute.** This means that you will only be rewarded for at most **one message a
minute**.

<Card title="Example" icon="magnifier">

If the server you are chatting in is configured to give **15 XP** per message,
you can earn **at most 75 XP** by sending multiple messages over a 5-minute
period.

</Card>

Despite this, **message count** shown on the
[leaderboard](/overview/leaderboard) does count multiple messages a minute.

## Modifying message counts

Unlike experience, message counts **cannot** be modified by administrators. See
our policy on [data legitimacy](/setup/legitimacy).
