:::caution[Feature Required]

Economy must be **enabled** in your server before it can be used. Enable it via
the [dashboard](/setup/dashboard).

:::

Engauge features a highly customizable economy system. Each server can
[configure](/setup/economy) properties of the economy such as:

- Currency symbol (default **E$**)
- Currency on level up (default **E$150**)
- Starting currency (default **E$500**)

Currency is generally obtained by leveling up. It can be created by server
administrators with the [/give](/commands/give) command. It can also be dropped
by [crates](/setup/crates).

## Payments

If currency transfers are enabled, you can pay other members in your server with
the [/pay](/commands/pay) command.

## Shop

<PremiumRequired />

Servers can configure a [**shop**](/setup/economy/shop), where members can
purchase roles and other items.

If your server has a shop, visit it through <Breadcrumbs path={['@dash',
'Server', 'Shop']} />.

## Games

<PremiumRequired />

Servers can optionally enable [**economy games**](/setup/economy/games), where
members can partake in interactive games using their balance.

Currently, the only available game is [Blackjack](/commands/blackjack).
