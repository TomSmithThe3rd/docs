Engauge is highly customizable, and its [web dashboard](https://engau.ge/dash)
is the primary means of customizing your server.

## Customizing your server

:::caution[Permissions Required]

To edit Engauge on the web dashboard, you need the **Manage Server** or
**Administrator** permission in the server you are trying to edit.

:::

<p>
  Navigate to <Breadcrumbs path={['@dash', 'Your Server', 'Edit']} /> to
  configure Engauge in your server.
</p>

The **sidebar** on the left allows you to navigate to editing different parts of
your server, such as [roles](/setup/roles) or [crates](/setup/crates).

## Editors

Configuring Engauge happens in its "editors," which are pages full of input
fields and radio buttons that control Engauge's behavior. When you change one, a
**save** button will appear at the bottom of your screen. Clicking it will
commit your changes and save it. Your changes will go into effect immediately.

:::tip

Two moderators can edit settings at the same time. Only settings you change will
be updated.
