import Breadcrumbs from '../../../components/Breadcrumbs.astro';

Engauge can configure certain roles to earn XP at different rates than normal.

<p>
  Engauge can also give and take roles in your server from members as they
  [level up](/overview/xp). You can access the roles configuration page at
  <Breadcrumbs path={['@dash', 'Your Server', 'Edit', 'Roles']} />.
</p>

## Permissions

Engauge requires the **Manage Roles** permission to give and take roles from
users. If this permission is not set, your role rewards will not function as
expected.

Moreover, Engauge's role needs to be higher in the hierarchy than the roles it
is trying to give. For more details, see the
[troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting).

## Configuration

### XP multiplier

Roles can set an XP multiplier that controls if they get more or less XP than
the normal rates.

:::tip[Roles Exempt from Earning XP]

If you'd like to make a role that cannot earn XP, set its XP multiplier to 0.

:::

XP multipliers can be any decimal number that is at least zero. By default, all
roles have an XP multiplier of 1, which means they earn a standard amount of XP.
An XP multiplier of 2 means that that role earns twice as much XP as normal.

A member's XP multiplier is the **XP multiplier of their highest role**. If any
of their roles contains a 0x multiplier, then that 0x multiplier is used
instead.

**XP multipliers do not stack.** The highest role in the hierarchy is used
instead.

### Level messages

A role can be configured to have a separate level message from the default level
message. This option uses the same [formatting](/setup/formatting) templates
that regular level messages use.

When a member levels up and earns a new level role, Engauge will use a level
message (if available) of that new role.

:::tip

It's possible to only show level messages when a user levels up and earns a
role, and not normally.

<p>
  To do this, navigate to{' '}
  <Breadcrumbs path={['@dash', 'Your Server', 'Edit', 'Settings']} />. Then, set
  the <b>Level message</b> option to be blank.

</p>

Now, you can set a role reward's level message to anything else. This will cause
Engauge to only show the message when roles are earned.

### Stacking

Role stacking allows you to control how level roles stack with each other. For
example, it allows you to control whether you want a user to have both a **Level
5** role and a **Level 10** role at the same time.

In your role settings page, you have three options for role stacking:

- **Role stacking enabled:** This role is allowed to stack with all other level
  roles.
- **Role stacking disabled:** This role is _not_ allowed to stack with other
  level roles, and will be removed as soon as the user levels up and gets a
  higher-level role.
- **Role stacking disabled with stacking group set:** Similar to the previous
  option, this option prevents role stacking with higher-level roles, but **only
  for some roles**.

  You can set a "stacking group" by typing in the text box. By setting multiple
  roles to use the same "stacking group," you can prevent roles from within that
  group from stacking together.

  This allows you to stack separate "groups" of roles, like separate progression
  paths.

#### Stacking use cases

Below are some use cases for each of the stacking options;

- **Role stacking enabled**
  - Adequate for **permission roles**, like send images, talk in a new channel,
    use emoji
  - This will allow the user to keep the permission roles when they continue to
    level up, and they will not be removed if they reach another level role that
    is given at a higher level.
- **Role stacking disabled**
  - Adequate for **level number roles** (**Level 5**, **Level 10**, etc.)
  - This pattern ensures the user always has the highest level role but none
    beneath it.
  - This also works great for level number roles with different names
    (**Newbie**, **Regular**, **Frequenter**, **Top Chatter**, etc.)
- **Role stacking disabled with a stack group**
  - Multiple sets of level number/level name roles
  - If you want to have both **Level 5**, **Level 10**, **Level 20** roles and
    **Newbie**, **Regular**, **Frequenter** roles at separate levels, you can
    use a stack group for each set of roles
  - All level roles of one group (for example, **Level 5**, **Level 10**,
    **Level 20**, etc.) must be given one group name, perhaps `levels`
  - All level roles of the other group(s) (for example, **Newbie**, **Regular**,
    **Frequenter**, etc.) must be given to a different unique name, perhaps
    `level names`

:::note[Caveat]

If you have only a single role in a stacking group set to **role stacking
disabled with a stack group**, it will act like **role stacking enabled** as
there are no other roles in the group to prevent stacking.

:::

### Required roles

You can set a role reward to "require" the member to have another role.

If you set this field, the user _must have the role(s) you picked_ before
Engauge will give them the role, if they meet the level requirement.

You can use this to create separate progression tracks, like having your members
"opt into" different progression trees.

:::caution[Footgun]

**Don't set the previous level role as required for the next.** Engauge handles
successive level role logic differently. Only use this feature for required
roles who you are expecting the user to have permanently.

:::

## Troubleshooting

### Manage Roles permission

Engauge needs the **Manage Roles** permission to manage member roles.

### Role hierarchy

In order for Engauge to give level roles, **Engauge's role must be higher than
the level roles**.

In your role settings, ensure the **Engauge** role is above the level roles.
Drag it so that it is on top of the level roles.

#### Sample role order

1. Admin role
2. **Engauge** (or another role Engauge has, with **Manage Roles**)
3. Level 50\*
4. Level 25\*
5. Level 10\*
6. Member

_\* This is a level role._

Notice how the **Engauge** role is above the starred (\*) level roles. If
**Engauge** would be below the Level 10 role, Engauge would not be able to hand
any of these level roles out.
