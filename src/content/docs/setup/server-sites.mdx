A **server site** is the set of pages tailored to your particular server. When a
member visits the dashboard and clicks <Breadcrumbs path={['View']} /> on your
server, they visit the server site.

While visiting your server site, the title bar of the Engauge website will
change to your server's name and icon.

## Customization

<PremiumRequired />

At the moment, [Premium](/setup/premium) servers can customize a bio/description
for their server, and it will be displayed on the front page of the server site.
This can be done from the main <Breadcrumbs path={['@dash', 'Your Server',
'Edit', 'Settings']} /> page.

More customization is in the works, such as header backgrounds, themes, and
layout options.
