Engauge's crates system allows you to create highly configurable crate drops
that periodically [(automatically or manually)](#criteria) drop goods like
[XP](/overview/xp) or [currency](/overview/economy).

<p>
  Navigate to <Breadcrumbs path={['@dash', 'Your Server', 'Edit', 'Crates']} />{' '}
  to create and edit your server's crates.
</p>

## Configuration

Click the large `New Crate` button to create a new crate.

### Announcement

The announcement settings allow you to control what the crate will look like
when it drops, as well as where it should drop.

Some notable fields:

- The **Message** field can be configured to use [formatting](/setup/formatting)
  templates like level messages.
- The **Announcement channel** field controls where the crate will "drop" when
  it is time to drop. If you leave this option unset, then the crate will drop
  in one of the contributing channels (see [Reward section](#reward)).

### Reward

The reward settings control what the crate actually gives your members when they
claim it. Crates can drop XP, currency, or both.

- Set **Maximum redeemers** if you'd like to make it so that the crate can only
  be claimed by a certain number of people at a time. The default, `0`, means
  there is no limit.
- The **Contributing channels** represent the channels that "charge" this crate
  (see [Criteria section](#criteria)).
- The **Redemption time** is how many seconds the crate can be claimed for after
  it is dropped.
- The **Cooldown** is how many seconds the crate waits after its redemption time
  to start charging again.

:::tip

Once a crate drops, it cannot be dropped again until the **redemption time**
_and then_ the **cooldown time** have elapsed. If you want the crate to become
droppable again immediately, set the **cooldown** to 0 seconds.

:::

### Criteria

The criteria of the crate controls what "charges" it, or brings it closer to
dropping automatically.

- **None, drops manually:** the crate never drops automatically, and you must
  always [drop it manually](#dropping-crates-manually).
- **Drop after a specified amount of messages sent:** the crate charges with
  each message that is sent in any of its [contributing channels](#reward). Only
  messages that earned XP count (see
  [message spam prevention](/overview/messages#spam-prevention)).
- **Drop on a time interval:** the crate automatically drops a certain number of
  minutes after it last became droppable. This means the crate will drop every
  (redemption seconds + cooldown seconds + time interval minutes).

  :::tip[Crates at Specific Times]

  If you are trying to make a crate that drops daily (for example), keep in mind
  that the **redemption time** and **cooldown** count towards this interval!

  If your crate has a redemption time of 300 seconds (5 minutes) and a cooldown
  of 60 seconds (1 minute), you will need to make the time interval equal to
  `1440 - 5 - 1` = **1434** to make the crate drop at exactly the same time each
  day.

### Copying crate settings

You can copy a crate by clicking the blue copy button in the top left of the
crate settings page. This creates a new crate with all settings copied from the
original, but with a new name.
