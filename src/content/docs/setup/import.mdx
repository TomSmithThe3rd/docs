Description: Overview of import capabilities in Engauge.

import { TabItem, Tabs, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import Breadcrumbs from '../../../components/Breadcrumbs.astro';

Engauge supports importing data from a number of other leveling bots. Select one
to view steps on how to import from it.

:::danger

Importing from another bot **permanently erases** all Engauge member data and
replaces it with the imported data. If the operation fails, it's not promised
that your old data will still exist. Please be positive you want to import
before importing blindly!

## Requirements

<Tabs syncKey="bot">
  <TabItem label="Mee6">
    <p>To import from Mee6, the following conditions must be met:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your server must have an active Mee6 leaderboard.</li>
      <li>Your server's Mee6 leaderboard must be set to public.</li>
      <li>All role rewards must be tied to existing roles.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Making your server public</h4>
    <p>
      If your Mee6 server is not public, Engauge cannot read its data and import
      properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Navigate to <Breadcrumbs path={['Mee6', 'Your Server', 'Leaderboard']} />{' '}
      and check <b>Make my server's leaderboard public</b>.
    </p>
    <h4>Tying role rewards to existing roles</h4>
    <p>
      If you have some Mee6 role rewards that are tied to roles you've since
      removed, they will fail to import in Engauge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please check your Mee6 configuration and remove any role rewards that are
      now obsolete.
    </p>
  </TabItem>
