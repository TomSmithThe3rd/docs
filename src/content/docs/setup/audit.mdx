description: Overview of Engauge's audit log feature.

import Breadcrumbs from '../../../components/Breadcrumbs.astro';

Engauge tracks the changes to your server's configuration in its **audit log**.

The audit log can be visited by <Breadcrumbs path={['@dash', 'Your Server',
'Edit', 'Audit']} />.

Actions such as settings changes, crate changes and drops, leaderboard resets,
etc. will all be logged here for a week.
