## Adding Engauge

<Steps>

1. Login to the [Engauge site](https://engau.ge/dash)

2. Locate your server on the <Breadcrumbs path={['@dash']} /> and click `Add`

3. Follow Discord's steps to add Engauge to your server

4. Edit your server following the links from the [/help](/commands/help) command
   or via <Breadcrumbs path={['@dash', 'Your Server', 'Edit']} />

</Steps>

## Configuration

<p>
  Engauge is highly configurable. All of its configuration is done via the
  [dashboard](/setup/dashboard), which can be accessed by navigating to
  <Breadcrumbs path={['@dash', 'Your Server', 'Edit']} />.
</p>

The sidebar on the left of your server's screen will allow you to navigate to
the settings pages for different aspects of the bot:

- **Settings** contains most "quick" settings, like
  [message](/overview/messages) and [voice](/overview/voice) [XP](/overview/xp)
- The **Roles** page allows you to set custom [role rewards](/setup/roles)
- **Crates** lets you create and drop custom [crates](/setup/crates)
- **Economy** and **Shop** let you configure your server's
  [economy](/setup/economy), if you want one
