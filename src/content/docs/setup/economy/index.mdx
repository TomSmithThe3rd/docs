Engauge features a highly customizable economy system. For a more high-level
overview, see [Economy](/overview/economy).

<p>
  To use economy features, they must first be enabled by checking <b>Enabled</b>{' '}
  at <Breadcrumbs path={['@dash', 'Your Server', 'Edit', 'Economy']} />.
</p>

## Configuration

You can choose to enable economy games. See [Games](/setup/economy/games) for
more information.

### Currency symbol

The symbol Engauge's economy uses can be controlled. By default, the symbol is
`E$`, meaning currency appears like **E$100**. Emojis are allowed.

For example, you could change this to `€` to render your currency as **€100**.

### Rates

The **starting currency** and **currency on level up** options control how much
currency you start with and how much you earn per level, respectively.

### Transactions

You can choose to set a **Transaction log channel**. This channel will have all
transactions (through [/pay](/commands/pay) or through the
[shop](/setup/economy/shop)) logged in real time.

Enable or disable [/pay](/commands/pay) transactions with the **Allow
transactions** option. You can also set whether to ping people on payment and a
minimum for currency transfer here.

## Resetting the economy

You can reset the economy at the bottom of the page with the **Reset Economy**
button.

This operation will set everyones' currencies back down to how much they would
have if they had not spent or were given any money. In other words, they will
start at their **Starting currency** plus the **Currency on level up** for each
of their levels.
