<PremiumRequired />

Engauge allows you to create a shop for your server, with custom items
purchasable using your server's [currency](/setup/economy).

<p>
  Navigate to <Breadcrumbs path={['@dash', 'Your Server', 'Edit', 'Shop']} /> to
  access shop settings. You will need to enable the shop before your members can
  view it.
</p>

## Shop items

<p>
  The heart of the shop is the items you add to it. Click{' '}
  <Breadcrumbs path={['Edit items', '+']} /> to add an item to your shop.
</p>

### Configuration

You can control the name, price, and description of your shop items. But more
importantly, you can control what the item gives the member who purchases it:

- **Give the purchaser some roles:** when a member purchases this item, they
  will be given all roles you've defined.
- **Give the purchaser some XP towards their level:** when a member purchases
  this item, they'll get as much XP as you've set.
- **Configure a custom reward:** functionally does nothing, but will log the
  item and message to the [transactions channel](/setup/economy#transactions),
  if you've configured one.

  This allows you to manually fulfill an item request, like an external game or
  other resource.

## Use your shop

<p>
  Navigate to <Breadcrumbs path={['@dash', 'Your Server', 'View', 'Shop']} /> to
  purchase shop items. At the moment, the only way to purchase shop items is
  from the website, though a way to purchase items in-chat is planned.
