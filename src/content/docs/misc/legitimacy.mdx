title: Data Legitimacy
---

A frequently requested feature of Engauge is the ability to modify user stats
like [messages](/overview/messages) and [voice minutes](/overview/voice).

Engauge has a strict data legitimacy policy that prevents end users from
tampering with factual data like these stats. This way, voice minutes and
messages are accurate _globally_, and you won't be surprised when an admin in
your server has a quadrillion messages sent.

The only way these stats can be inorganically modified is through
[importing](/setup/import) from other services.
