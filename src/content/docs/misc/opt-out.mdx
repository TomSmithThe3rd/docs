description: Instructions on how to opt-out from data collection entirely.

import { LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

If you would like to opt out from all forms of data collection on your Discord
account by Engauge, you can use the [opt-out page](https://engau.ge/opt-out).
This will prevent Engauge from processing your data, storing your level, and so
on. You will be unable to use Engauge in any capacity, and you will disappear
from all leaderboards globally.

:::caution

Bear in mind that opting out from data collection will **permanently delete all
of your existing data**, meaning **your data will not be recoverable**.

:::

When opting out, your Discord user ID will be stored internally to flag your
account as having opted outâ€”all other data is **permanently erased**.

You can choose to opt back into data collection at any time by manually logging
into the [Engauge dashboard](https://engau.ge/dash) again.
